## Loading and preprocessing the data
Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data

1. Load the data (i.e. 𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚍.𝚌𝚜𝚟())
```{r}
data <- read.csv(unzip("activity.zip"))
```

2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

Перводим время в POSIXlt

```{r}
data$date <- as.POSIXct(data$date)
```




## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
steps_number <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, sum)
```

2. If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
hist(steps_number, xlab = "number of steps", main = "the total number of steps taken each day")
```

3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

Mean 
```{r mean}
meanDay <- mean(tapply(data$steps, data$date, sum), na.rm = T)
print(meanDay)
```

Median
```{r}
 medianDay <- median(tapply(data$steps, data$date, sum), na.rm = T)
print(medianDay)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
Mean and median number of steps taken each day
Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r}

mean_interval <- tapply(data$steps, data$interval, mean, na.rm = T)

plot(mean_interval, type = "l", main = "time series plot", xlab = "the 5-minute interval", ylab = "the average number of steps")
```


2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps? 
```{r}
which.max(mean_interval)
```


## Imputing missing values
Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
```{r}
stepsNA <- sum(is.na(data$steps))
dateNA <- sum(is.na(data$date))
intervalNA <- sum(is.na(data$interval))
```
Missing values in steps is `r stepsNA`.

Missing values in date is `r dateNA`.

Missing values in interval is `r intervalNA`


NA pattern explore
```{r}
table(is.na(data$steps), data$interval)
```

```{r}
barplot(is.na(data$steps))
```


2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.



3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
dataFix <- data
for (i in unique(dataFix$interval)) {
        dataFix$steps[is.na(dataFix$steps) & dataFix$interval == i] <- round(mean(dataFix$steps[data$interval == i], na.rm = T))
}
```

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

```{r}
steps_numberFix <- tapply(dataFix$steps, dataFix$date, sum)

hist(steps_numberFix, xlab = "number of steps", main = "the total number of steps taken each day Fix")
```
```{r}
meanDayFix <- mean(steps_numberFix)
medianDayFix <- median(steps_numberFix)
```
```{r}
meanDay - meanDayFix
medianDay - medianDayFix
```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends

For this part the 𝚠𝚎𝚎𝚔𝚍𝚊𝚢𝚜() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r}
dataFix$weekD <- as.POSIXlt(data$date)$wday == 0 | as.POSIXlt(data$date)$wday == 6

dataFix$weekD <- factor(dataFix$weekD, levels = c(F, T), labels = c("weekday", "weekend"))
```


2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

```{r}
stepsWeekD <- tapply(dataFix$steps[dataFix$weekD == "weekday"], dataFix$interval[dataFix$weekD == "weekday"], mean)

stepsWeekE <- tapply(dataFix$steps[dataFix$weekD == "weekend"], dataFix$interval[dataFix$weekD == "weekend"], mean)
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
plot(stepsWeekD, type = "l", main = "weekdays"
     ,xlab = "the 5-minute interval"
     ,ylab = "the average number of steps")

plot(stepsWeekE, type = "l", main = "weekdends"
     ,xlab = "the 5-minute interval"
     ,ylab = "the average number of steps")

```
